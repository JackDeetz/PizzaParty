Lab 1 Assignment
Overview

In this lab, you will be getting familiar with Kotlin and the Android Studio environment and building the Pizza Party app by following the guide in ZyBooks 2.4.  In addition to building the app, you will learn how to use version control by committing your app to a GitHub repository. See ZyBooks chapters 1-2.

Create a video demo (required)

Create a video demo of your app running in the Android Studio emulator. Be sure to demonstrate how the app works, and also show your code and the KDoc comments.  You can record your screen with our phone, or use free software to capture your screen such as Jing (Links to an external site.), or Screencast-O-Matic (Links to an external site.). Please show all parts of the app, and explain anything that is not obvious. 

What to submit

The URL of your app's GitHub repository.
The URL of your video demo.
Note: You will get a grade of 0 on this lab assignment if a video demo is not included with your submission
Note: If you upload it on YouTube, it is recommended set the video to "unlisted". I cannot view private videos, and you probably don't want it public but that is up to you.
